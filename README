README for ddodn

ddodn (deck donkey odrive new)

The code ddodn is listed here without any guarantee to function. It's mostly to peruse
and use as a person sees fit. I change it constantly while I am modifying my DD deck donkey!

This code with some modification will drive a 4 wheel device running two Odrive controllers,
which I hope to post on github soon.

I code with a open source QtCreator IDE (C++) which runs on my PC and my Jetson Nano using 
LGPLv3 license a copy of which should be in this git source. I have also included a copy
of a GPLv3 license for other code that may need to be covered. 

This code is made to run on Jetson Nano(ARM). I have my Nano set up with QtCreator installed
so I can compile it natively. I find it faster and I didn't want to cross compile on 
my PC. This code will also run on a PC or Laptop (AMD/INTEL) running Ubuntu. One might have
some luck running on an RPi 4
 
 The code mostly controls an Odrive 3.6 56v controller running in ASCII mode which controls two
 BLDC RoboWheels RW170 these wheels have a built in optical encoder which is easier and smoother to control.
 
 I have commented some of the code out, the second odrive and the time of flight (TOF) sensors
 
 One thing that is necessary is the serial number of the Odrive device; if in fact that is the controller
 a person is using:
 
 
 QString odrv_3_serial_number = "3677385E3030"; // use your number this is mine:))
 
 this is found in ddodn.h
 
If one changes out their Odrive they would have to change the serial number in ddodn.h

On the gui of this app 'ddodn.png' I have disabled most items that are not being used

Enough said for now. If you have any questions my email is:

andylaberge@linux.com

I will post any pertinent questions and answers here in the README for now.

Thank you for your time and interest!
